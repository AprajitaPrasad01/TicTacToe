# Java Swing Tic-Tac-Toe

A classic desktop Tic-Tac-Toe game built with Java, featuring a graphical user interface created using the **Swing** and **AWT** libraries.

This project serves as a great example for beginners learning GUI development in Java. It demonstrates fundamental concepts like event handling, component layout, and state management within a Swing application.

## Features

-   **Interactive 3x3 Grid**: A clean and simple game board.
-   **Two-Player Mode**: Supports classic human-vs-human gameplay.
-   **Turn Indicator**: A status label clearly shows which player's turn it is ('X' or 'O').
-   **Win and Draw Detection**: The game automatically detects and announces when a player wins or the game is a draw.
-   **Reset Functionality**: A "New Game" button to easily reset the board and start over.

## Technologies Used

-   **Java**: Core programming language.
-   **Java Swing**: Used for creating the GUI components (`JFrame`, `JButton`, `JLabel`, etc.).
-   **Java AWT**: Used for layout management (`GridLayout`, `BorderLayout`) and event handling (`ActionListener`).
